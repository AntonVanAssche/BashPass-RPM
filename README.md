## About BashPass-RPM

BashPass-RPM is a repository that contains all the necessary files and build scripts required to package [BashPass](https://www.github.com/AntonVanAssche/BashPass) and [BashPass-Remote](https://www.github.com/AntonVanAssche/BashPass-Remote) as RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) packages.
The repository simplifies the process of building and deploying [BashPass](https://www.github.com/AntonVanAssche/BashPass) and [BashPass-Remote](https://www.github.com/AntonVanAssche/BashPass-Remote) on systems that use the RPM package manager, such as Fedora, AlmaLinux, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
